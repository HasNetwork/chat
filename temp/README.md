## Feature Requests

First scan and understand my current app and then implement these features in it. Here's the complete feature list ordered according to priority of requirement:

1. Users can Reply, React, Edit, Delete messages but not uploaded files.
2. Admin can remove (not ban) users from rooms.
3. User last seen, online, message seen, typing indicators.
4. UI for online people should also be in the same area as the room list.
5. UI Revamp, details below.
6. Figure out how to migrate old database to the new version without losing data.

## UI Revamp

This commit need to introduce a major visual overhaul of the application, implementing a "glassmorphism" design.

#### Key changes:

- Add a nature-themed background image to all pages.
- Implement a translucent, blurred panel effect for UI elements.
- Update the font to "Inter" for a more modern look.
- Ensure a consistent design across the login, register, admin, and main chat pages.
